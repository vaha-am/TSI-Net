# TSI-Net
Multi-modal network inference framework to construct Transcriptome-Small Molecule Interaction Network (TSI-Net)

This repository contains code implementations for the paper "Construction of Multi-Modal Transcriptome-Small Molecule Interaction Networks from High-Throughput Measurements to Study Human Complex Traits" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.22.634403)

# Short Description
The project is divided into three parts: 1. A protocol for processing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data, 2. A semi-supervised method for constructing multi-modal networks, and 3. An analysis of the multi-modal TSI-Nets with respect to human complex traits. Code implementations for parts 1 and 2 are available in this repository.
